# About

I'm an Identity and Access Management Architect working in the Microsoft Identity space.

I'm a Microsoft MVP (Enterprise mobility) and I'm also the P-TSP for ADFS and Azure AD for Microsoft NZ in Auckland.

I deliver systems based mainly on the Microsoft Identity stack:

- Azure AD
- Azure AD B2B / B2X
- Azure AD B2C (including custom policies)
- ADFS
- ADFS WAP
- ADAL
- MSAL
- Microsoft Identity Platform
- Microsoft.Identity.Web
- WIF
- Other stacks when appropriate e.g. identityserver / Auth0

I have an absolute passion for evangelising Identity.
