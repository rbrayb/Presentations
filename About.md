# About

I'm an independent Identity and Access Management Architect working in the Microsoft Identity space.

I live in Auckland, NZ.

I'm also a Microsoft MVP (Security/I&AM).

I deliver systems based mainly on the Microsoft Identity stack:

- Entra ID
- Entra External ID (B2B/B2X)
- Azure AD B2C (built-in and custom policies)
- ADFS
- ADFS WAP
- MSAL
- Microsoft Identity Platform
- Microsoft.Identity.Web
- WIF (WS Federation)
- SAML
- OpenID Connect / OAuth
- Verified ID
- Other stacks when appropriate e.g. identityserver / Auth0

I have an absolute passion for evangelising Identity.
